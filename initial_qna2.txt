1. Graph theory background
 - directed graph means that the edge goes in one direction only while undirected graphs are bidrection edges
 - it basically represents a diagonal matrix of each node

2. Linear Algebra
 - this operation does a matrix multiplication operation on the 2 matrices
 - This operation is used to calculate an aggregated matrix

3. GNN Intuition
 - Graph neural networks are used to create neural networks on unstructured data
 - i dont know about this one
